# Step1 - terraform apply

Most people like to see a "Hello World!" example when they are learning a new computer language, so who am I to disappoint.

To run it, make sure you [download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) terraform and place the executable in your PATH, then:

    cd step1
    terraform apply

Terraform has returned the outputs of the 'module', a single variable 'msg' with the contents of "Hello World!".

:pencil: More info about terraform outputs can be found in the offical docs [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/outputs.html)

## Prepare for the next step

    cd ..
    git checkout step2

Head over to `step2/step2.md`
